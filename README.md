# About this project
The main purpose of this project is to get me familiar with git.

The logic I want to implement is simple. 
A definition not in `.tf` file to `metadata`,`metadata` to `.tf` file.
It will be almost hard-coded - so not elegant - one.

If you are looking for an elegant one, you would be interested in `cf2tf`.
