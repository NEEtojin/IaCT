# IaCT
Infrastructure as Code Translator (which is not elegant at all!!!)

# About this project
The main purpose of this project is to get me familiar with git.

The logic I want to implement is simple. `IaC1` to `metadata` and `metadata` to `IaC2`.
It will be almost hard-coded - so not elegant - one.

If you are looking for an elegant one, you would be interested in `cf2tf`.
